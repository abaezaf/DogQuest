# DogQuest

Be a (canine) hero!

DogQuest is a Space-Invader-esque game made by the Pygame module in Python.



## Installation

You need to have installed Pygame in your computer before executing DogQuest

Use the package manager pip in your terminal to install Pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

You can also download the lastest [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) version in the module official website.

The game will also need to have the DogQuest and Resources folders in the same main folder.

There is no need of extra installation as the game will create automatically a database in the main folder once it is initially played.

### Requiriments

As indicated in the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pygame==2.0.1
```



## Execution

```python
python main.py
```
